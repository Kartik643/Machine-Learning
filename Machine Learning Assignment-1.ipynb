    "1.Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "2.Machine Learning\n",
    "3.Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 1.Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language understanding. AI systems can analyze data, learn from it, and make informed decisions based on patterns and experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A virtual personal assistant like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. These AI-driven systems can understand spoken language, respond to questions, set reminders, and even control smart home devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. It's about creating models that can improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Email spam filters. Instead of hardcoding rules for what constitutes spam, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not-spam. The algorithm then learns to identify patterns in the email content, sender, and other features, allowing it to classify incoming emails as spam or not-spam more accurately over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on using neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to solve complex problems. Deep learning has gained significant attention due to its remarkable ability to automatically learn hierarchies of features from raw data, leading to state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model, can automatically learn to identify features like edges, textures, and shapes from raw image data. By stacking multiple layers, these networks can recognize intricate patterns and objects in images, such as identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog."

    "Q2- What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. In this approach, the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs, where the inputs are the features of the data, and the outputs are the corresponding labels or target values. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the algorithm can accurately predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs.\n",

    "Q3- What is Unsupervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns and relationships within a dataset without being provided with explicit labels or target values. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm is guided by labeled data, unsupervised learning aims to find inherent structures in the data without predefined categories. Unsupervised learning is often used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of unsupervised learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering: Grouping similar data points together based on their features. For example, clustering algorithms can be used to group customers with similar purchasing behavior for targeted marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining its essential information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common technique used for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly Detection: Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm. This can be useful for fraud detection or identifying faulty products in manufacturing."
