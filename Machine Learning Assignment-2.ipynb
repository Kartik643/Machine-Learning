    "Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:To reduce overfitting in machine learning models, you can employ several techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Introduce penalty terms to the model's loss function that discourage overly complex parameter values. Common regularization techniques include L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Split your data into training and validation sets, and use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on different subsets of data. This helps you gauge how well your model generalizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Choose relevant features and remove irrelevant ones. Fewer features can help the model focus on important patterns and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Stopping: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training. When the performance stops improving or starts degrading, stop training to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmentation: Generate more training data by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, or cropping to existing data. This increases the diversity of the training set and can help the model generalize better."

It typically arises when the model lacks the complexity needed to adequately represent the relationships within the data.\n",
